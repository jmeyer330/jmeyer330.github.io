<h1 align="center">Jarod Meyer</h1> 
<p align="center">My name is Jarod Meyer and welcome to my janky html webpage! I am a Sophomore in 
Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, and hopefully this page will help you 
get to know more about me and what I do!</p> 
<h1> Who is this guy?</h1>
<p>If you got through the first sentence and my horrid picture, you're probably wondering who the heck this guy is? To give you an idea, here are some of my interests outside of schoolwork/my major:

<li>Running (Cross Country and Track)</li>
<li>Cooking (Korean food and Spaghetti)</li>
<li>Programming (Currently Java and Python, looking to expand into C++)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Professional Info: </h1>
<p>If you are looking for actual professional info, a link to my resume (as of Aug 2017) can be found <a href = "https://github.com/jmeyer330/jmeyer330.github.io/blob/master/Resume.pdf">here!</a> </p>
<p>To go along with that, a brief description of some of my main projects (as of Nov 2017) are below:</p>

<h3> Flexible Inorganic Thin Films via Controlled Spalling (in Progress)</h3>
<p> As part of the ICORLAB Research group in the ECE department at UIUC, I am assisting with research in inorganic thin films for flexible electronics. I am using electron-beam deposition and electroplating to induce controlled-spalling in semiconductor wafers, a method to transfer off flexible films with superior electrical properties.</p>
<h3> Coin-Audio Machine Learning Project (Summer 2017)</h3>
<p>For this project I sound-proofed my basement and recorded the sound of a US coin dropping onto a ceramic tile. After getting 1000 audio samples of a Nickel, Penny, Quarter, or Dime dropping, I made a small program with the Python Librosa to quickly convert all audio files into spectrograms to be fed into a machine learning algorithm. In Nvidia Digits, I cut/fine-tuned a pre-designed machine learning algorithm, and was able to increase the identification rate of a coin based on its spectrogram from 55% to 76%.</p>
